            I hope that you've been doing well, I know it's been awhile since we've last spoken. I have been really busy with attending college as well as BloomTech. I'm reaching out to let you know that I've decided to pursue a career in the tech industry. I'm currently enrolled in Full Stack Web Developer program at BloomTech, an online coding boot camp. Right now I'm seeking advice from anyone who works in the field as I know transitioning industries is never easy and would like to set myself up for success. Although I know that you no longer work in the field, I know that you still have your contacts as well as know maybe who would be beneficial for me to connect with?

            Specifically, I'm interested in learning more about different roles within the tech industry, gaining insights into the day-to-day responsibilities of tech professionals, and understanding the skills and experiences that are valued most in the field.

            I appreciate any help you can provide and will continue to stay in touch as I continue this journey!

            Love Always, 
            Your Daughter
